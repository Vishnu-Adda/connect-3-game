# connect-3-game
It's just tic-tac-toe, but it looks like Connect 4.

There is a yellow and a red player. Whoever connects three checkers in a row will win. You have the option to replay the game if you want. 

The app uses a 3x3 GridLayout with multiple child ImageViews to replicate a tic-tac-toe game. Animations have been used for extra flair.
